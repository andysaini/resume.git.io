    <h3><u>ABSTRACT:</u></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Technology is a never-ending process. To be able to design a product using the current technology that will be
        beneficial to the lives of others is a huge contribution to the community. This project presents the design and
        implementation of a low cost but flexible and secure cell phone based home automation system. The design is
        based on a standalone Arduino BT board and the home appliances are connected to the input/ output ports of this
        board via relays. The communication between the cell phone and the Arduino BT board is wireless. This project is
        designed to be low cost and scalable allowing variety of devices to be controlled with minimum changes to its
        core. Password protection is being used to only allow authorized users from accessing the appliances at home
        remotely.

    <h3>1. Introduction:</h3>
    <p class="introp">• In present world of technology, all the things are going computerized and automated from
        machinery
        to simple paperwork every process and system has to do something with computer, i.e. they are in some or the
        other way connected to computers.

        Keeping that in our mind we are designing our project 'Appliances Automation' which will be a small working
        model of an automated and mobile controlled system. <br>
        • It will demonstrate how we can control devices and control all the operations through mobile remotely. It will
        become more managed and automated due to comfort it supply, especially when installed in a private lab. The
        device automation is a means that give users access to control appliances. Many well-accepted lab automation
        systems are based on wired network.
        Wireless systems can be of great importance for automation systems. With the wireless practical application such
        technology as Wi-Fi, networking in recent past years, Wi-Fi systems are used everywhere.

    <h3><u>4 Modules </u></h3>
    <br>
    <h3>1. GSM (Global System for Mobile)</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="gsm"> • In this module user initiates the call with their respective GSM cell phones. <br>
        • Arduino receives the call according to the range of the calling. <br>
        • The connection is been established with the proper range. <br>
        • Controlling is been done via the DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) codes. According to our demand, we can set
        the controlling of the different appliances through it. In our module, we have been set the ON to one keyword
        and OFF to two keyword we can change it according to our need. <br>

    <h3>2. GPRS (General Packrt Radio Service)</h3> <br>
    <p class="gprs"> • This module user goes to the respective website and click on the server connectivity as soon as
        the connection is been established the end user clicks the ON and OFF button according to the command.
        Then the event occurs to the respective commands as the end user gives into it.

        <br> • As soon as the event occurs the data is immediately uploaded to the server and the data in the server is
        been
        enhanced.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>3. Temperature and Humidity Sensor</h3><br>
    <p class="temp">• The DHTI 1 temperature range is from Ot050 degrees Celsius with +-2 degrees accuracy. While the
        DHTI 1 humidity
        ranges from 20t080percentage with 50 0 accuracy. DHTII is a low-cost digital sensor for sensing temperature and
        humidity. This sensor can be easily interfaced with any micro-controller such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc... to
        measure humidity and temperature instantaneously.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>4. Curtain Control System</h3><br>
    <p class="curton"> • We can close and open our curtains directly from the mobile. <br>
        • We can choose for one or two curtains and even set how far they should be opened. <br>
        • We can also set timers to open and close them at a fixed time. If you want to, you can always continue to open
        and close them manually. <br>
    </p> <br>

    <h2 id="p"><u>Conclusion</u></h2><br>
    <br>
    <p>• In this work, the proposed system facilitates the users to control the appliances such as lights, fans, projector
        and air conditioner just by giving commands through either a smart phone or Node-RED Dashboard. Thus, all
        devices can be controlled universally and remotely and the status of the devices can be visualized. This feature
        will help the user to analyze the status of these devices anytime and anywhere. It reduces human intervention in
        monitoring the devices. This system can be further extended for automatic ON and OFF appliances depending upon
        the number of users in the Lab using Omron thermal sensors. This system can be further implemented in hospitals
        for physically challenged people for controlling the appliances.</p>
